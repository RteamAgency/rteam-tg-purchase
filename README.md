# rteam-tg-purchase

One-tap **Purchase Order approvals in Telegram** for Odoo 19. CEO/CFO sign-off
from a phone, anywhere — no VPN, no Odoo login, no inbox dig.

## What it does

When a Purchase Order at or above the configured threshold is confirmed, the
order is held in draft and a Telegram message with inline **Approve / Reject /
View in Odoo** buttons is delivered to the configured approver. One tap and
the PO confirms; the chatter records who approved and when.

## Dependency

This module sits on top of [`rteam_tg_auth`](https://github.com/RteamAgency/rteam-tg-auth) —
the source-agnostic Telegram approval ledger + 2FA core. Install
`rteam_tg_auth` first (or alongside, Odoo will resolve the order) and bind
your approver(s) to Telegram via My Preferences before the gate can fire.

## Branches

- `main` — primary working branch.
- `19.0` — exact mirror of `main`, the branch apps.odoo.com Scan reads from.

Per Rteam Odoo Apps convention every push to `main` is mirrored to `19.0`.
17.0 / 18.0 backports follow on demand.
