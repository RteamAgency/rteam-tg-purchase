Rteam Telegram Approvals: Purchase Orders
=========================================

Stop chasing your CEO with "please confirm PO #1234". When a Purchase
Order over your threshold is confirmed, an inline Telegram message
goes straight to the approver's phone with three buttons: Approve,
Reject, View in Odoo. One tap and the PO confirms in Odoo, the
chatter records who approved and when. No VPN, no Odoo login, no
inbox dig.

How it works
------------
1. Install this module on top of ``rteam_tg_auth``.
2. The approver completes Bind Telegram once in their Odoo
   Preferences (60 seconds via the deep link the bot sends them).
3. Set Settings -> Telegram -> Purchase Approvals: a Threshold (the
   amount above which approval is required) and a Default approver.
4. From now on, when a Purchase Order at or above the threshold is
   confirmed, the order is held in draft state and a Telegram
   message with inline Approve / Reject buttons is delivered to the
   configured approver. Their tap flips the order to confirmed or
   leaves it in draft, and posts a chatter note linking the action
   back to the approver and the time.

Security
--------
Each inline button carries an HMAC-signed callback payload. An
attacker who learns a request id alone cannot forge a tap without
the per-instance webhook secret. Telegram messages and webhook
callbacks share the same path-and-header secret; the bot token
never leaves your database.

Reliability
-----------
* Stale requests (24h default) auto-expire on a 30-minute cron, with
  a chatter note on the source PO.
* Approver opens the same PO in Odoo? The header shows a "View
  Telegram approval" button so they can see exactly which TG message
  is in flight.
* Re-confirming a PO with an open request raises a clear error
  rather than spawning a duplicate.
* Self-approve is blocked: requester == approver = no Telegram
  detour, the order confirms normally.

This is one of a planned family of source-model integrations on top
of the same ``rteam_tg_auth`` ledger -- Vendor Bills, Time Off,
Expenses are next. Building your own is one method on the source
model: ``on_rteam_tg_approval_resolved(request, new_state)``.
